# TCP-IP-Sockets-Program-Server-and-client

A socket is a way for most common operating systems to let programs communicate over the network. It enables applications (processes that are not related) on different machines that are connected by a network to exchange messages.

The sockets way of communication can work with any kind of network. However, IP is the most widely used network and the most common use of sockets.

#Implimented in python, this exercise gave me a deeper understanding of socket mechanism, fundamentals of building servers, and for TCP/IP communication in particular. Love to see the server and client communicate from exploring an interface to the nework layer with code.
